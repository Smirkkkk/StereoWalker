# CityWalker: Learning Embodied Urban Navigation from Web-Scale Videos

### TL;DR: CityWalker leverages thousands of hours of online city walking and driving videos to train autonomous agents for robust, generalizable navigation in dynamic urban environments through scalable, data-driven imitation learning.

# Getting Started
## Installation
The project should be compatible with latest Pytorch and CUDA versions. The code is tested with Python 3.11, PyTorch 2.5.0, and CUDA 12.1. To install the dependencies, run:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate citywalker
```

## Data Preparation
Please see [dataset/README.md](./dataset/README.md) for details on how to prepare the dataset.

## Training
To train the model, run:
```
python train.py --config configs/citywalk_2000hr.yaml
```
We provide our **pretrained model** in the [releases tab](https://github.com/ai4ce/CityWalker/releases).

## Fine-tuning
To fine-tune the model, run:
```
python fine_tune.py --config configs/citywalk_2000hr.yaml --checkpoint <path_to_checkpoint>
```

## Testing
To test the model, run:
```
python test.py --config configs/citywalk_2000hr.yaml --checkpoint <path_to_checkpoint>
```
